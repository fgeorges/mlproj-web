# Concepts

Here is a quick definition of some terms and concepts used in the documentation
and/or defined by `mlproj`.

- **project** - A project in `mlproj` has no precise definition.  It is a
  directory, that contains a subdirectory `xproject/`, itself containing the
  project definition in `project.xml` and the environment files in `mlenvs/`.
  All that is created for you by `mlproj new`.

  Apart from that, a project can be anything you would like it to be!
