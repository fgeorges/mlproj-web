# Install

`mlproj` uses Node.js to run and NPM to be installed.  Both can simply
be installed by installing Node from http://nodejs.org/.

Once NPM is installed, installing `mlproj` is as simple as the
following:

<pre>
<b>$</b> npm install mlproj -g
</pre>

We got rid of all dependencies that were an issue on some platforms.
Nowadays `mlproj` should install smoothly on all systems.  If you have
any problem, please [shout out](../contact).
