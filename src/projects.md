# Projects

The overall project directory layout follows the one defined by XProject.
Everything is handled for you when you create the project using `mlproj new`.

Essentially, all that is used is that the code must be in the directory `src/`,
whilst the project-related data is under `xproject/` (this includes the project
descriptor in `project.xml`, and the environments in `mlenvs/`.)
